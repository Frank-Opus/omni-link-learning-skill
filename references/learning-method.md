# Learning Method

## Principle

Use "summarize first, then absorb in stages" to avoid overload.

## Stage Design

1. **Orientation**: understand the big picture and relevance.
2. **Structure**: map claims, evidence, and concept relationships.
3. **Application**: transfer ideas to concrete scenarios.
4. **Retention**: spaced recall and teach-back.

## Retrieval-First Rules

- Ask memory questions before re-reading notes.
- Prefer short free recall over passive review.
- Force one practical example after each stage.

## Spaced Schedule

- D0: first full pass
- D1: recall key points without notes
- D3: rebuild logic chain from memory
- D7: apply in a real task and reflect

## Completion Criteria

Declare "fully understood" only when the learner can:
- explain the thesis in plain language
- defend it with evidence
- identify limits and assumptions
- apply at least one idea in context
